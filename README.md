WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT?

AdventureWorks2019 is a Microsoft sample database that allowed me to write SQL queries and utilize them to develop dashboards with two BI tools: Tableau and PowerBI. Each was used to create a portfolio that could showcase what I had learnt over time.

While working on these I always wondered if it was possible to use Machine Learnig to extract inshights from the data that might have some meaning and thus increase the usefulness of the analysis. Over time I have always looked at ML with a certain curiosity trying to learn the basics of it, until I came across a python library that simplifies a lot of steps that lead to write an algorithm, that is able to work and give valid information: the library in question is called Pycaret.

The idea I had is to use the data on customers, extracted from the DB through a query, and try to divide them into clusters using an ML algorithm. For this purpose I will use Pycaret.
